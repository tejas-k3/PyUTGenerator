A Python code that performs the following tasks:

Scanning the Directory: The code will take a source (src) directory as input and recursively scan through it and its subdirectories up to a configurable depth. This scanning process aims to gather information about the functions defined in Python files within the codebase.

Extracting Function Information: While scanning the directories, the code will extract information about the functions present in the Python files. This information could include the function name, input parameters, and any other relevant details.

Generating Unit Test Methods: After gathering function information, the code will generate unit test methods for each function found in the previous step. These unit test methods will be created in a separate unittest file per Python file. The naming convention for these unittest files will be unitTest_<WhateverFileName>. Additionally, a new directory named unitTest_DirectoryName will be created to store these unittest files.
